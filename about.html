      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Java backend developer who is passionate about creating applications that are high-performance, scalable, and efficient. Having practical experience with Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA, and RESTful APIs, I have contributed to projects that have improved my knowledge of database administration (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and microservices architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my academics, I developed and implemented an Electricity Billing System, which strengthened my understanding of backend development and database management. After earning my degree, I worked on projects that demonstrated my ability to create reliable backend systems, such as a movie API project and a weather simulation application.
      </p>
      <p>
        My ability to solve problems and my dedication to writing clear, maintainable code enable me to create effective backend solutions that promote flawless user experiences. I am constantly excited to investigate new technologies, enhance backend functionality, and participate in worthwhile projects. Let's connect and collaborate!
